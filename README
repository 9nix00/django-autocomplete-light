It is called django-autocomplete-light because the API is light.

In a hurry ?
------------

Install in 3 steps:

- add ``url(r'autocomplete/', include('autocomplete_light.urls')),`` to
  ``urls.py``,
- call ``autocomplete_light.autodiscover()`` in ``urls.py`` before
  ``admin.autodiscover()``,
- add after loading ``jquery.js``: ``{% include
  'autocomplete_light/static.html' %}`` - even in ``admin/base_site.html`` if
  you even need admin support:

Use in 3 steps - if you even need admin support:

Example ``your_app/autocomplete_light_registry.py``::

    # This actually creates a thread safe subclass of AutocompleteModelBase.
    autocomplete_light.register(SomeModel)

Login as staff and open ``/autocomplete/`` to check that it was properly
registered.

Example ``your_app/forms.py``::

    # Use as much registered autocompletes as possible.
    SomeModelForm = autocomplete_light.modelform_factory(SomeModel, 
        exclude=('some_field'))

Example ``your_app/admin.py``:

    # Ok that one's too easy ...
    class AddressAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = SomeModelForm
    admin.site.register(Address, AddressAdmin)

Far from the best setup but sufficient to move on with your project. Did
something go wrong ? Are you "not so confortable using django apps yet" ? Then
try the `Quick start guide
<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quick.html>`_ which
has a lot more details and will help you get a better setup.
